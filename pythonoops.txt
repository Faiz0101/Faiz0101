Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?
* Object-oriented programming languages make it easier to understand how a program works by bringing together data and its behavior (or method) in a single bundle called an object.


Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?
* An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, then in the class the instance was created from, then in all higher superclasses, progressing from left to right (by default). The search stops at the first place the attribute is found.

Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?
* The Object is an actual thing that is built based on the 'blue print' (like the house). An instance is a virtual copy (but not a real copy) of the object.

Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?
* The self is used to represent the instance of the class. With this keyword, you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.

Q5. What is the purpose of the init method?
* The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose.

Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?
* The process for creating class instance is same as class object for that class.

Q7. What is the process for creating a class?
* To create a class, use the keyword class followed by name of class.

Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?
* A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created. The subclasses inherit the characteristics of a superclass. The superclass is also known as the parent class or base class.

Q9. What is the relationship between classes and modules?
* Modules are collections of methods and constants. They cannot generate instances. Classes may generate instances (objects).
So a module in python is simply a way to organize the code, and it contains either python classes or just functions. If you need those classes or functions in your project, you just import them.

Q10. How do you make instances and classes?
* classes are created by using class keyword followed by class name. Instances are created by creating objects of a class.

Q11. Where and how should be class attributes created?
* A class attribute is shared by all instances of the class. To define a class attribute, you place it outside of the __init__() method.

Q12. Where and how are instance attributes created?
* Instance attributes are defined in the constructor. Defined directly inside a class. Defined inside a constructor using the self parameter.

Q13. What does the term "self" in a Python class mean?
* The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

Q14. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?
* The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the "+" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the "+" operator is overloaded by the "int" class and "str" class. 

Q15. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?
* The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the "+" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the "+" operator is overloaded by the "int" class and "str" class. 


Q16. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?
* A very popular and convenient example is the Addition (+) operator. Just think how the '+' operator operates on two numbers and the same operator operates on two strings. It performs “Addition” on numbers whereas it performs “Concatenation” on strings.

Q17. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?
* Both inheritance and polymorphism are fundamental concepts of object oriented programming. These concepts help us to create code that can be extended and easily maintainable

Q18. Describe three applications for exception processing.
*
a) handles errors in a better way
b) the next lines of code are uninterrupted'
c) we can raise exceptions as per our produc needs

Q19. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?
* The further lines of code will not execute and program will get crashed.

Q20. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?
* By handling it using except block.

Q21. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.
* One is by using raise keyword, other is by creating custom exception class.

Q22. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.

Q23. What is the purpose of the try statement?
* When we enclose a code in try block , if the code has errors and not executed completely then it can be handled in the except block.

Q24. What are the two most popular try statement variations?
* try-except and try-finally

Q25. What is the purpose of the raise statement?
* To raise custom exceptions.

Q26. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?
* The assert keyword is used when debugging code. The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.

Q27. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?
* In Python, with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams. Observe the following code example on how the use of with statement makes code cleaner. 

Q28. What are *args, **kwargs?

*args- this is used when we are not sure of the exact number of arguments passed as a parameter to a function
**kwargs - this is used when we are not sure of the exact number of arguments passed as a parameter to a function


Q29. How can I pass optional or keyword parameters from one function to another?

Q30. What are Lambda Functions?
* This function can have any number of arguments but only one   
 expression.
Q31. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?
* Ineritance is a oop concept in which a child class will have access  to its parent class's functions and attribute

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  pass

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

Q32. Suppose class C inherits from classes A and B as class C(A,B).Classes A and B both have their own versions of method func(). If we call func() from an object of class C, which version gets invoked?
* Here the function of class A gets executed first because A is the         fisrt passed parameter.

Q33. Which methods/functions do we use to determine the type of instance and inheritance?
* Two built-in functions isinstance() and issubclass() are used to  check inheritances.

Q34.Explain the use of the 'nonlocal' keyword in Python.
* The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside nested  functions, where the variable should not belong to the inner function. Use the keyword nonlocal to declare that the variable is not local

Q35. What is the global keyword?
* In Python, the global keyword allows us to modify the variable outside of the current scope.
